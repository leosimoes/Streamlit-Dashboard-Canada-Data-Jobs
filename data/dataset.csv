Over 200 applicants,18586257.0,Abnormal Security,Full-time,"About The Role

Abnormal Security is looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join the Message Detection - Attack Detection team. At Abnormal, we protect our customers against nefarious adversaries who are constantly evolving their techniques and tactics to outwit and undermine the traditional approaches to Security. That‚Äôs what makes our novel behavioral-based approach so‚Ä¶Abnormal. Abnormal has constantly been named as one of the top cybersecurity startups and our behavioral AI system has helped us win various cybersecurity accolades resulting in being trusted to protect more than 8% of the Fortune 1000 ( and ever growing ).

In a landscape where a single successful attack can lead to financial losses of millions of dollars, the Attack Detection team plays the central role of building an extremely high recall Detection Engine that can operate on hundreds of millions of messages at milliseconds latency. The Attack Detection team‚Äôs mission statement is to provide world-class detector efficacy to tackle changing attack landscape using a combination of generalizable and auto trained models as well as specific detectors for high value attack categories.

This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely precise systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message). These signals are then combined and utilized to train highly accurate model based as well as heuristic detectors. Additionally, to continuously adapt to new unseen attacks, the team builds out different stages in our automated model retraining pipelines including data analytics and generation stages, modeling stages, production evaluation stages as well as automated deployment stages.

This role would also have an opportunity to have a significant impact on the overall charter, direction and roadmap of the team. The Machine Learning Engineer would be involved in understanding the domain of false negatives i.e. the current and future attacks which can cause significant customer workflow disruption. They would help define the technical roadmap required to address the most pressing customer problems and simultaneously operate our detection decisioning system at an extremely high recall.

What you will do


 * Design and implement systems that combine rules, models, feature engineering, and business and product inputs into an email detection product, with senior engineer guidance.
 * Understand features that distinguish safe emails from email attacks, and how our model stack enables us to catch them.

 * You'll build upon Float's data infrastructure and determine which technologies and tools the company should use for its data science activities.

About Quora

Quora‚Äôs mission is to grow and share the world‚Äôs knowledge. To do so, we have two knowledge sharing products:



 * Quora: a global knowledge sharing platform with over 400M monthly unique visitors, bringing people together to share insights on various topics and providing a unique platform to learn and connect with others.
 * Poe: a platform that lets people ask questions, get instant answers, and have back-and-forth dialogue with various AI language models (bots). As AI capabilities rapidly advance, Poe provides a single platform to instantly integrate and utilize these new models.
   
   
   

Behind these products are passionate, collaborative, and high-performing global teams. We have a culture rooted in transparency, idea-sharing, and experimentation that allows us to celebrate success and grow together through meaningful work. Join us on this journey to create a positive impact and make a significant change in the world.

About The Team And Role

A Quora internship is not an ordinary internship. There's no busy work. Every project that our interns work on is important to the company and its goals.

As a team, we are dedicated to holding high standards, developing a strong and passionate culture, and emphasizing impact. We value building a culture with strong engineering values and goals because we believe that it is the key to building a great company and product. Interns play an important role in this, as they work alongside full-time employees as equals, working on the same projects that help drive the company and product forward. We expect interns to become valuable contributors to the team, as they work hand-in-hand with people ranging from engineering to design to business development.

We also realize that mentorship is important to allow interns to grow and develop skills in areas which they're looking to improve. For example, every intern will have a full-time engineer as a mentor, and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well. We also emphasize code reviews and hold weekly engineering tech talks to maintain high code quality and to optimize for learning the best engineering practices.

This internship will run for 16 weeks beginning in April.

Over 200 applicants,18586257.0,Abnormal Security,Full-time,"About The Role

Abnormal Security is looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to join the Message Detection Decisioning team. At Abnormal, we protect our customers against nefarious adversaries who are constantly evolving their techniques and tactics to outwit and undermine the traditional approaches to Security. That‚Äôs what makes our novel behavioral-based approach so‚Ä¶Abnormal. Abnormal has constantly been named as one of the top cybersecurity startups and our behavioral AI system has helped us win various cybersecurity accolades resulting in being trusted to protect more than 8% of the Fortune 1000 ( and ever growing ).

In a landscape where a single successful attack can lead to financial losses of millions of dollars, the Message Detection Decisioning team plays the central role of building an extremely precise Detection Engine that can operate on hundreds of millions of messages at milliseconds latency. Every email ingested by Abnormal flows through the workflow owned by the Detection Decisioning team which applies hundreds of signals and detectors on a message based on the message and user context. The system then computes the final overall decision for the system and consequently chronicles attribution to drive various offline and online metrics such as offline precision, online precision, online False Negative Rate etc.

This team is solving a multi-layered detection problem, which involves modeling communication patterns to establish enterprise-wide baselines, incorporating these patterns as robust signals, and combining these signals with contextual information to create extremely high precision systems. The team builds discriminative signals at various levels including message level (eg. presence of particular phrases), sender-level (eg.frequency of sender) and recipient level (eg.likelihood of receiving a safe message) which forms the foundation to create highly accurate heuristic and model based detectors. Additionally to maintain an overall high precise detection system, the team innovates on software systems and processes which can be quickly adapted to solve trends seen in the short term as well as generalize well in the longer term.

This role would also have an opportunity to have a huge impact on the overall charter, direction and growth of the team. The Senior Machine Learning Engineer would be involved in understanding the most pressing customer problems in the domain of false positives and build out the associated technical roadmap to continuously operate our detection decisioning system at an extremely high precision.

What you will do


 * Design and implement systems that combine rules, models, feature engineering, and business and product inputs into an email detection product.
 * Identify and recommend new features groups or ML model approaches that can significantly improve detection efficacy for a product. Work with infrastructure & systems engineers to productionize signals to feed into the detection system.
 * Understand features that distinguish safe emails from email attacks, and how our detector stack enables us to catch them.
 * Be the expert in main detection pipelines and decision data flow to be able to drive debugging in systematic degradations caused by bad detectors.
 * Writes code with testability, readability, edge cases, and errors in mind.
 * Train models on well-defined datasets to improve model efficacy on specialized attacks
 * Actively monitor and improve False Positive rates and efficacy rates for our message detection product attack categories, through feature engineering, rules and ML modeling.
 * Analyze False Negative and False Posi datasets to categorize capability gaps and recommend short term feature and rule ideas to improve our detection efficacy.
 * Contribute in other areas of the stack: building and debugging data pipelines, or presenting results back to customers in our tools when the occasion arises
 * Lead the team‚Äôs medium and long term roadmap and drive planning and execution strategy for the pod.
 * Coach and mentor junior engineers to uplevel their code quality and ML effectiveness by providing quality code reviews and design reviews.
 * Participate in building a world-class detection engine across all layers - data quality, feature engineering, model development, experimentation and operation.
   
   

Must Haves


 * Track record of success in translating business requirements into scalable, maintainable systems with a bias toward simpler but iterative systems.
